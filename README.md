# SuperHeroHunter

this a super hero hunter web application developed using the HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and Javascript. And this is single page application.

In this project we are fetching the API from https://developer.marvel.com/docs.

Approach:
1. first we need to decide the UI how to implement. 
   a. in nav bar it should have the Home tab, Favourites tab to goto the favourite superheros and one search bar to search super heros.
   b.in the body it should display the every super hero that are available in super hero list.
   c. super hero card should be having the image, name and details page button and favourite button to add into favouraties.
   d. if we click on the favourites tab it should display the favourite heros we added and option to remove from favourites
   e. the super hero details page should be having image, name and super hero comics and series.
   
2. Functionalitie of application.
   a. if we clicks on the favourite button the hero should be added to favourites.
   b. if we clicks on the remove button the hero should be removed from the favourites.
   c. if search the hero the page sholud be filtering out the heros as per search.
   d. if clicks on the find me button it should display us the details of the hero.
   e. even though we close and open the browser the favourite tab should be having the same list of heros as it is before close.

Note: Appication will take 2-3 sec to load and display the heros list from the API
